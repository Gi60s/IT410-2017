# Git

## What is it?

- A file versioning system.

- Be able to revisit any point in history.

- Work on a single project simultaneously with other developers.

- Accept contributions to your code from anyone.

- Make changes without compromising stability.

## Repositories

- *Repository* - The current and past state of all of your tracked files since the creation of the git project.

- *Local Repository* - A repository on your own machine. Most of your work is done here.

- *Central Repository* - The repository that everyone uses to get code from and merges new code into.

## In Class Exercise

### Step 1:

1. Create a new central repository on Github.
2. Clone the central repository onto your local machine.
3. Add a file on your local machine. (From here on, check git status with each step).
4. Stage the file.
5. Commit the file.
6. Push changes to the local repository.

### Step 2:

Join up with a class mate. You each will perform these steps on the other's repository.

1. Clone the other repository to a new directory on your machine.
2. Add a file, stage and commit it, and push.

### Step 3:

Working with another class mate on a single repository:

1. Both of you add different files and make changes.
2. Stage, commit, and push the files to the central repository.

### Step 4:

Working with branches. Useful for making changes that lead to code instability.

### Step 5:

Pull requests


## Terminology

- *Fork* - A copy of another repository that becomes a new repository. The new repository will be modified and then eventually will be made into a pull request.
- *Pull Request* - A request to merge a fork with a central repository.

## Why Use Versioning

### Scenario 1: All Alone

- You make changes.
- You commit those changes.
- You push the changes to the central repository.
- You could go to another computer and pull down the latest from the repository.
