# Introduction

## We'll Be Building a Web Application

Assignment:
<assignment id='hello'></assignment>

**A Static Web Site**

- Does not recognize the user.
- Has generic informational content.
- Reloads the entire page to get new content.

**A Web Application**

- Recognizes the user and stores information about that user.
- Provides custom content.
- Dynamically updates page content without reloading the page.
- Accepts user input.

### Questions

**Question:** Is Facebook (http://facebook.com) a Static Website or a Web Application?
<br>

**Answer:** It is clearly a web application. You can chat live with someone, post, and get new posts without ever having to reload the page. Additionally, posts are tailored to you.
<br>

**Question:** Is Google Search (http://www.google.com) a Static Website or a Web Application?
<br>

**Answer:** It is a Web Application. Even if you don't log in, cookies are used to identify your computer and search is customized based on many factors.
<br>

<hr>
**Question:** Can anyone think of a static website that they know of?
<br>

**Answer:** Most if not all of the popular websites are now web applications.

## How We Will Build It

- Web browsers understand JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so we'll cover each of those.

    - HTML is easy
    - CSS is easy to learn and hard to master
    - JavaScript is hardest to learn, but also very powerful.

- We'll use [Google's Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) to facilitate building a complex web front-end web application.

- We'll write automated testing suites that will make sure our code works before so that we won't have to do as much manual testing.

- We'll define web services using the [Open API Initiative](https://openapis.org/) standards.

- We will write a custom server that will deliver our application to the client (browser) using JavaScript and NodeJS.

- We will use MongoDB for our database storage.

## Why Take This Class

This class will:

1. Help you build your own custom web application (so start thinking about what you want).

2. Start you on the path of mastering JavaScript.

    > JavaScript has plenty of redeeming qualities: performance unmatched by any other dynamic language, unparalleled community and ecosystems, the best write once; run anywhere of any programming language, universal JS (one program that runs in browsers, on servers, and in mobile devices), a flexible multi-paradigm system that lets you write programs in the style that suits you and your projects, and the list goes on.

    JavaScript is gaining momentum faster than any other language and in most reports is ranked as the most popular language (3 years running).

    JavaScript is the language of the web.

3. Help you to be a star programmer.

4. Teach you the very latest trends in web application development (including some bleeding edge technology).

5. Inform you of how the top web application developers in the industry currently write code.

6. Help you to understand the myriad of techniques that exist for developing JavaScript, when you would use them, and why.

7. Can fundamentally change the way that you write code.

## Assignments and Grades

A [grading tool](https://github.com/Gi60s/IT410-grader) has been developed to grade each of your assignments (except the final project).

You can use the [grading tool](https://github.com/Gi60s/IT410-grader) to grade your assignments on your own machines. I'll be using the same grading tool to grade each of your assignments.

The grader will tell you how many points of the possible 25 points you will get on the assignment, but depending on when your assignment is submitted, you may not receive full credit:

| Percent of Score  | Submission Date        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 100%              | On time                |
| 80%               | Up to 1 week late      |
| 60%               | Up to 2 weeks late     |
| 0%                | More than 2 weeks late |

Exceptions for late assignments may be granted for extenuating circumstances.

Assignments build on one another, so it's important to stay on top of things.


## Final Project

I **highly recommend** that everyone complete a final project for this class.

- It's worth 30% of your grade.

- It will help you to master course material.

**Requirements:**

- Build a dynamic front end web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Components.

- Write a custom server in JavaScript.

- Use MongoDB for a database.

- Users must be able to create and use a login.

- Users must be able to provide input and have a dynamic experience.

- The final project should be polished. It must look and act like a finished web application.

**Alone or with a Group**

- You can work alone or in groups of two or three people.

- If you have more people working on the project then more will be expected of your final project.

**Project Proposal**

- Due: Wednesday, January 18th, in class.

- I will speak with you (and your group) during class about your project. You can tell me what you plan and I may make some suggestions.

**Project Presentation**

- Due: Last day of class

- Present your working final project in front of the class.
